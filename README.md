Tomato Tracker - music tracker for terminal
===========================================

There is quite limited choice of music creation tools on Linux. They are often
also limited in terms of usability. Tomato Tracker is loosely inpired by LSDJ,
a popular music editor for Gameboy. Despite using only a few buttons, LSDJ
seemed surprisingly easy to learn and navigate. The interface of Tomato Tracker
is purely text based - it can be run in any terminal.

Another objective behind Tomato Tracker is moderation in consumed space.
Because of that the main method of sound creation will be software synthesis.

Currently the application is in early concept stage. To compile it, use make.
To learn how to use it, read quickstart.md.
