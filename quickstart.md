Quick Start Manual
==================

The documents which are edited in Tomato Tracker are called songs. The main
part of the song are tracks, each of which contains a sequence of phrases.
Phrases in turn are sequences of patterns. A pattern is a smallest reusable
fragment of music and it usually corresponds to a bar.

Because user interface is text based, all input is done with a keyboard.
Different parts of the song are edited in different views:
* Song view
* Phrase view
* Pattern view
* Instrument view
* Properties view

When the tracker is started, the song view is displayed.
